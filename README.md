## About

Paperlink is a clean and lightweight platform for storing, organizing, viewing, and editing PDFs in the browser.  
It’s designed to replace the usual mix of folder chaos and messed up PDF tools with a single, consistent interface that’s easy to host and use.

You can upload documents, annotate them in the browser, leave page-based comments, and work together in real time.  
The platform is built for self-hosting.
